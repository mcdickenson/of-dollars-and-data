# Of-Dollars-And-Data
Repo for OfDollarsAndData.com blog

The numbering of files is consistent with the blog posts on the website.  The blog post number is at the bottom of a given post.  The numbering is also the same across the import, build, and analysis folders.  I did this in order to make it easier to track down how data gets into the system (import), how it gets manipulated/cleaned up (build), and how I visualize or quantify it (analysis).

brew install R
Rscript install_libraries.R
